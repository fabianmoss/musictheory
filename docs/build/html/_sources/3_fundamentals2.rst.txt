.. Western tonal music
   -------------------

The diatonic scale
------------------

Music in the Western tradition fundamentally builds on
so-called *diatonic* scales, an arrangement of seven tones
that are named with latin letters from A to G. "Diatonic" can 
be roughly translated into "through all tones". Within this scale,
no tone is privileged, so the diatonic scale can be appropriately 
represented by a circle with seven points on it. Mathemacally, 
this structure is equivalent to :math:`\mathbb{Z}_7`.

Now, if we want to determine the relative relations between the tones, 
it is necessary to assign a reference tone that is commonly called the *tonic*, 
or *finalis* in older music.

For example, if the tone D is the tonic, we can determine all other scale degrees 
as distance to this tone. 
Scale degrees are commonly notated with arabic numbers with a caret. Their common names
are given in parentheses (after Aldwell & Schachter):

.. math::
   \text{D}: \hat{1} &\quad\text{(tonic)}\\
   \text{E}: \hat{2} &\quad\text{(supertonic)}\\
   \text{F}: \hat{3} &\quad\text{(mediant)}\\
   \text{G}: \hat{4} &\quad\text{(subdominant)}\\
   \text{A}: \hat{5} &\quad\text{(dominant)}\\
   \text{B}: \hat{6} &\quad\text{(submediant)}\\
   \text{C}: \hat{7} &\quad\text{(leading tone)}

It is interesting to consider the semantincs of these names.
The do not only give names to the scale degrees in linear order,
but rather specify a network of relations.
The two most important scale degrees are the *tonic* and the *dominant*. 
The names of all other scale degrees are given in relation to either or both 
of them but not in a very consistent way:
The *supertonic* is one step above the tonic, and the *leading tone* one step below
and its name also indicates an inherent voice-leading tendency and thus a functional role.
The *subdominant* is the tone below the dominant, but the "sub-" prefix is ambiguous
because it could also mean the "dominant below the tonic". Both definitions coincide
and have been discussed in music theory.
The *mediant* is the middle between tonic and dominant, which happens to be a
third above the tonic. The *submediant* is, accordingly, a third below the tonic,
or, in the alternative interpretation of "sub-", the mediant between the tonic and the 
subdominant.

Since our example was a Dorian scale, the leading-tone terminology does not make much sense.

.. Sinve the relations between tones only given by 
   their location in tonal space (and the interval function)
   generalizing the notion of neighbor notes etc. corresponds
   to changing what the *lines* in Western notation mean.
   Traditionally, two lines separate tones that are a generic third apart.
   But there have been other representations. 
   For instance, the first attempts of Guido separated notes by steps.
   Let's reinterpret the lines as seconds and fifths. 
   There have also been a number of attempts to develop a fully chromatic
   notation system (Parncutt).
