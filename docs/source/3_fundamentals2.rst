.. Western tonal music
   -------------------

The diatonic scale
------------------

Music in the Western tradition fundamentally builds on
so-called *diatonic* scales, an arrangement of seven tones
that are named with latin letters from A to G. "Diatonic" can 
be roughly translated into "through all tones". Within this scale,
no tone is privileged, so the diatonic scale can be appropriately 
represented by a circle with seven points on it. Mathemacally, 
this structure is equivalent to :math:`\mathbb{Z}_7`.

Now, if we want to determine the relative relations between the tones, 
it is necessary to assign a reference tone that is commonly called the *tonic*, 
or *finalis* in older music.

For example, if the tone D is the tonic, we can determine all other scale degrees 
as distance to this tone. Scale degrees are commonly notated with arabic numbers with a caret:

.. math::
   \text{D}: \hat{1}\\
   \text{E}: \hat{2}\\
   \text{F}: \hat{3}\\
   \text{G}: \hat{4}\\
   \text{A}: \hat{5}\\
   \text{B}: \hat{6}\\
   \text{C}: \hat{7}\\

Scales based on chromaticism

- chromatic

- octatonic
- whole tone

Modes

scale plus order plus hierarchy (but order already defined above?)

Different terminologies: 

- Messiaen's Modes
- Church modes 
- Indian modes (ragas)
- other modes?

.. Sinve the relations between tones only given by 
   their location in tonal space (and the interval function)
   generalizing the notion of neighbor notes etc. corresponds
   to changing what the *lines* in Western notation mean.
   Traditionally, two lines separate tones that are a generic third apart.
   But there have been other representations. 
   For instance, the first attempts of Guido separated notes by steps.
   Let's reinterpret the lines as seconds and fifths. 
   There have also been a number of attempts to develop a fully chromatic
   notation system (Parncutt).
