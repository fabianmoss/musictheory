Learn music theory the hard way!
================================

.. warning::
    The content on these pages is very much under construction!

Welcome!

This is not a pedagogical resource for basic music theory concepts
but an in-depth introduction into the structures of Western music,
built axiomatically from tones and their relations.
The logo, a `longa`_ (or a quadruple whole note), 
symbolically reflects this level of difficulty. since it is the longest
note value in Western music notation.
